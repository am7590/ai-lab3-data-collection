en|The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South
en|America. It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The
en|only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea
en|pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla,
en|and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of
en|water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large
en|as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted
en|for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin. It
en|is not considered a threatened species. == Etymology == Its common name is derived from
en|Tupi ka'apiûaracode: tpw is deprecated , a complex agglutination of kaácode: tpw is deprecated (leaf)
en|+ píicode: tpw is deprecated (slender) + úcode: tpw is deprecated (eat) + aracode: tpw
en|is deprecated (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".
en|The scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος
en|(choiros "pig, hog"). == Classification and phylogeny == The capybara and the lesser capybara both
en|belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their
en|extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies
en|have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of
en|both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while
en|using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus, but
en|more recently have adopted the classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines
en|is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines
en|has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth
en|show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material
en|once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar
en|shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.
en|Among fossil species, the name "capybara" can refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that
en|are more closely related to the modern Hydrochoerus than to the "cardiomyine" rodents like Cardiomys.
en|The fossil genera Cardiatherium, Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all capybaras under that concept. ==
en|Description == The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur
en|on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can
en|be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait
en|among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over
en|hair. Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length,
en|stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the withers, and typically
en|weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan
en|llanos of 48.9 kg (108 lb). Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded
en|weights are 91 kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg
en|(162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay. Also, an 81 kg individual was reported
en|in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002. The dental formula is 1.0.1.31.0.1.3. Capybaras have slightly
en|webbed feet and vestigial tails. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they
en|have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their
en|muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of
en|their heads. Its karyotype has 2n = 66 and FN = 102, meaning it has
en|66 chromosomes with a total of 102 arms. == Ecology == Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals
en|found throughout all countries of South America except Chile. They live in densely forested areas
en|near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes, as well as
en|flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can
en|hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished
en|in cattle ranches. They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density
en|populations.Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world.
en|Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.
en|In 2011, one specimen was spotted on the Central Coast of California. These escaped populations
en|occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras inhabited; late Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida and Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites
en|in California and Hydrochoerus gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may actually
en|fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene species. === Diet and predation === Capybaras are
en|herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark.
en|They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard
en|other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season,
en|as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have
en|to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during
en|the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at
en|that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding
en|back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a
en|source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms
en|their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They
en|also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case
en|with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant
en|wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously. Like its relative the guinea
en|pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not
en|supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a
en|sign of scurvy.They can have a lifespan of 8–10 years, but tend to live less
en|than four years in the wild due to predation from big cats like the jaguars
en|and pumas and non-mammalian predators like eagles and the caimans. The capybara is also the
en|preferred prey of the green anaconda. == Social organization == Capybaras are known to be
en|gregarious. While they sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups of around
en|10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the
en|remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during
en|the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds,
en|dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females
en|are herding young.Capybaras have two types of scent glands: a morrillo, located on the snout,
en|and anal glands. Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morrillos and
en|use their anal glands more frequently. The anal glands of males are also lined with
en|detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is
en|released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent
en|mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morrillos on objects,
en|or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread
en|their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently
en|than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in
en|estrus. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females. === Reproduction === When in estrus,
en|the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts
en|males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose. During mating, the female has
en|the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does
en|not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water.
en|Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of
en|the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male
en|to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but
en|subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The
en|lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents. Capybara gestation is
en|130–150 days, and produces a litter of four young on average, but may produce between
en|one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins
en|the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group
en|as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but
en|continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form
en|a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks
en|between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.
en|=== Activities === Though quite agile on land, capybaras are equally at home in the
en|water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes,
en|an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their
en|noses out. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze
en|during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They
en|rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn. == Conservation and human interaction
en|== Capybaras are not considered a threatened species; their population is stable throughout most of
en|their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers. Capybaras are
en|hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas, and otherwise killed by humans who
en|see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, which has
en|the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their
en|ability to breed rapidly.Capybaras have adapted well to urbanization in South America. They can be
en|found in many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in
en|captivity, more than double their wild lifespan. Capybaras are docile and usually allow humans to
en|pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be
en|vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria asked Drusillas
en|Park in Alfriston, Sussex, England, to keep the studbook for capybaras, to monitor captive populations
en|in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as
en|well as how they are related.Capybaras are farmed for meat and skins in South America.
en|The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it
en|is considered an important source of protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela,
en|capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued
en|special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden. After
en|several attempts a 1784 Papal bull was obtained that allowed the consumption of capybara during
en|Lent. There is widespread perception in Venezuela that consumption of capybaras is exclusive to rural
en|people.Although it is illegal in some states, capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the
en|United States. The image of a capybara features on the 2-peso coin of Uruguay. In
en|Japan, following the lead of Izu Shaboten Zoo in 1982, multiple establishments or zoos in
en|Japan that raise capybaras have adopted the practice of having them relax in onsen during
en|the winter. They are seen as an attraction by Japanese people. Capybaras became big in
en|Japan due to the popular cartoon character Kapibara-san.In August 2021, Argentine and international media reported
en|that capybaras had been causing serious problems for residents of Nordelta, an affluent gated community
en|north of Buenos Aires built atop wetland habitat. This inspired social media users to jokingly
en|adopt the capybara as a symbol of class struggle and communism. Brazilian Lyme-like borreliosis likely
en|involves capybaras as reservoirs and Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus ticks as vectors. == Popularity and meme
en|culture == In the early 2020s, capybaras became a growing figure of meme culture due
en|to many factors, including the disturbances in Nordelta which led to them being comically postulated
en|as figures of class struggle. Also, a common meme format includes capybaras in various situations
en|with the song "After Party" by Don Toliver, leading to a tremendous growth in popularity.
en|Due to a lyric in Toliver's song, capybaras are also associated with the phrase "Ok
en|I pull up". == See also == Josephoartigasia monesi, an extinct species identified as the
